<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div class="issue" data-number="123"></div>

<section id="context">

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>This document has been prepared in the context of Action 1.1 – Improving semantic interoperability in European eGovernment systems [[SEMIC]] of the European Commission’s Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) programme [[ISA]].</p> 
<p>Studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission [[Vickery]] show that businesses and citizens still face difficulties in finding and re-using public sector information. In its communication on Open Data [[EC-OD-COM]] of 12 December 2011, the European Commission states that the availability of the information in a machine-readable format as well as a thin layer of commonly agreed metadata could facilitate data cross-reference and interoperability and therefore considerably enhance its value for reuse.</p> 
<p>Much of the public sector information that would benefit from interoperability is published as datasets in data portals. Therefore, an agreement on a common format for data exchange would support the sharing, discovery and re-use of this data.</p> 
<p>This document is the result of the major semantic change release process described in the Change and Release Management Policy for DCAT-AP [[DCAT-AP-CRMP]] and was built starting from DCAT-AP version 1.2.1 [[DCAT-AP-20190528]].</p>

<h3>Scope of the revision</h3>

<div class="issue" data-number="122"></div>

<p>The objective of this work is to produce an updated release of the DCAT Application Profile based on requests for change coming from real-world implementations of the specification and an alignment with the upcoming release of W3C DCAT 2.0.</p> 
<p>The Application Profile specified in this document is based on the specification of the <strong>Data Catalog Vocabulary</strong> (DCAT) developed under the responsibility of the Government Linked Data Working Group [[W3C-GLD-WG]] at W3C. DCAT is an RDF [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web. Additional classes and properties from other well-known vocabularies are re-used where necessary.</p> 
<p>The work does not cover implementation issues like mechanisms for exchange of data and expected behaviour of systems implementing the Application Profile other than what is defined in the Conformance Statement in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#conformance"></a>.</p> 
<p>The Application Profile is intended to facilitate data exchange and therefore the classes and properties defined in this document are only relevant for the data to be exchanged; there are no requirements for communicating systems to implement specific technical environments. The only requirement is that the systems can export and import data in RDF in conformance with this Application Profile.</p> 

</section>

<section id="specification">

<h3>The DCAT specification</h3>

<p>The DCAT Application Profile defined in this document is based on the specification of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) of 16 January 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]], and the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2, W3C Candidate Recommendation 03 October 2019 [[VOCAB-DCAT-2-20191003]].</p>

<section id="terminology">

<h2>Terminology used in the DCAT Application Profile</h2>
</p>
<p>An <strong>Application Profile</strong> is a specification that re-uses terms from one or more base standards, adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended and optional elements to be used for a particular application, as well as recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used.</p>
<p>A <strong>Dataset</strong> is a collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats.</p>
<p>A <strong>Data Portal</strong> is a Web-based system that contains a data catalogue with descriptions of datasets and provides services enabling discovery and re-use of the datasets.</p>
<p>In the following sections, classes and properties are grouped under headings ‘mandatory’, ‘recommended’ and ‘optional’. These terms have the following meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory class</strong>: a receiver of data MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender of data MUST provide information about instances of the class.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended class</strong>: a sender of data SHOULD provide information about instances of the class; a sender of data MUST provide information about instances of the class, if such information is available; a receiver of data MUST be able to process information about instances of the class.</li>
<li><strong>Optional class</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process information about instances of the class; a sender MAY provide the information but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MUST provide the information for that property.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender SHOULD provide the information for that property if it is available.</li>
<li><strong>Optional property</strong>: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MAY provide the information for that property but is not obliged to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meaning of the terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY in this section and in the following sections are as defined in [[RFC2119]].</p>
<p>In the given context, the term "processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).</p>
<p>Classes are classified as ‘Mandatory’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-classes"></a> if they appear as the range of one of the mandatory properties in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a>.</p>
<p>The class ‘Distribution’ is classified as ‘Recommended’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#recommended-classes"></a> to allow for cases that a particular Dataset does not have a downloadable Distribution, and in such cases the sender of data would not be able to provide this information. However, it can be expected that in the majority of cases Datasets do have downloadable Distributions, and in such cases the provision of information on the Distribution is mandatory. </p>
<p>All other classes are classified as ‘Optional’ in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#optional-classes"></a>. A further description of the optional classes is only included as a sub-section in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a> if the Application Profile specifies mandatory or recommended properties for them. </p>
<p>The Application Profile reuses terms from various existing specifications. Classes and properties specified in the next sections have been taken from the following namespaces:</p>

<h2>Controlled Vocabularies</h2>

<section id="requirements-for-controlled-vocabularies">

<h3>Requirements for controlled vocabularies</h3>

<p>The following is a list of requirements that were identified for the controlled vocabularies to be recommended in this Application Profile.</p>
<p>Controlled vocabularies SHOULD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be published under an open licence.</li>
<li>Be operated and/or maintained by an institution of the European Union, by a recognised standards organisation or another trusted organisation.</li>
<li>Be properly documented.</li>
<li>Have labels in multiple languages, ideally in all official languages of the European Union.</li>
<li>Contain a relatively small number of terms (e.g. 10-25) that are general enough to enable a wide range of resources to be classified.</li>
<li>Have terms that are identified by URIs with each URI resolving to documentation about the term.</li>
<li>Have associated persistence and versioning policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria do not intend to define a set of requirements for controlled vocabularies in general; they are only intended to be used for the selection of the controlled vocabularies that are proposed for this Application Profile.</p>

</section>

<section id="controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used">

<h3>Controlled vocabularies to be used</h3>

<p>In the table below, a number of properties are listed with controlled vocabularies that MUST be used for the listed properties. The declaration of the following controlled vocabularies as mandatory ensures a minimum level of interoperability.</p>

<div data-include-format="html" data-include="./tables/controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used.html"></div>

</section>

<section id="other-controlled-vocabularies">

<h3>Other controlled vocabularies</h3>

<p>In addition to the proposed common vocabularies in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>, which are mandatory to ensure minimal interoperability, implementers are encouraged to publish and to use further region or domain-specific vocabularies that are available online. While those may not be recognised by general implementations of the Application Profile, they may serve to increase interoperability across applications in the same region or domain. Examples are the full set of concepts in EuroVoc [[?EUV-EUROVOC]], the CERIF standard vocabularies [[?CERIF-VOCS]], the Dewey Decimal Classification [[?DDC]] and numerous other schemes.</p>

</section>

<section id="licence-vocabularies">

<h3>Licence vocabularies</h3>

<p>Concerning licence vocabularies, implementers are encouraged to use widely recognised licences such as Creative Commons licences [[?CC]], and in particular the CC Zero Public Domain Dedication [[?CC0]], the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) [[?PDDL]], the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) [[?EUPL]] or an open government licence such as the UK Open Government Licence [[?UKOGL]].</p>

<section id="provider-requirements">

<h2>Provider requirements</h2>

<p>In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that provides metadata MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a description of the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-catalogue"></a>.</li>
<li>Provide information for the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-catalogue-record"></a>, if descriptions of Catalogue Records are provided – please note that the provision of descriptions of Catalogue Records is optional.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-dataset"></a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Distributions, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-distribution"></a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Data Services, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-data-service"></a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all organisations involved in the descriptions of Catalogue and Datasets, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-agent"></a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all category schemes that contain the categories that are asserted in any of the descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-category-scheme"></a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all categories involved in the descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-properties-for-category"></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the properties listed in the table in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a>, the associated controlled vocabularies MUST be used. Additional controlled vocabularies MAY be used.</p>
<p>In addition to the mandatory properties, any of the recommended and optional properties defined in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties"></a> MAY be provided.</p>
<p>Recommended and optional classes may have mandatory properties, but those only apply if and when an instance of such a class is present in a description.</p>

<section id="receiver-requirements">

<h2>Receiver requirements</h2>

<p>In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that receives metadata MUST be able to:</p>

<!-- Agent roles -->

<section id="agent-roles" class="informative">

<h2>Agent Roles</h2>

<p>The DCAT Application Profile specified in this document has a single property to relate an Agent (typically, an organisation) to a Dataset. The only such ‘agent role’ that can be expressed in the current version of the profile is through the property <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher"><code>dct:publisher</code></a>, defined as “An entity responsible for making the dataset available”. A second property is available in the DCAT recommendation, <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-20140116#Property:dataset_contactPoint"><code>dcat:contactPoint</code></a>, defined as “Link a dataset to relevant contact information which is provided using VCard”, but this is not an agent role as the value of this property is contact data, rather than a representation of the organisation as such.</p>
<p>In specific cases, for example in exchanging data among domain-specific portals, it may be useful to express other, more specific agent roles. In such cases, extensions to the base profile may be defined using additional properties with more specific meanings.</p>
<p>Two possible approaches have been discussed, particular in the context of the development of the domain-specific GeoDCAT Application Profile [[GeoDCAT-AP]], an extension of the base DCAT Application Profile. </p>
<p>The first possible approach is based on the use of a predicate vocabulary that provides a set of properties that represent additional types of relationships between Datasets and Agents. For example, properties could be defined, such as <code>foo:owner</code>, <code>foo:curator</code> or <code>foo:responsibleParty</code>, in addition to the use of existing well-known properties, such as <code>dct:creator</code> and <code>dct:rightsHolder</code>. A possible source for such additional properties is the Roles Named Authority List [[EUV-ROLES]] maintained by the Publications Office of the EU. Other domain-specific sources for additional properties are the INSPIRE Responsible Party roles [[INSPIRE-RPR]], the Library of Congress’ MARC relators [[MARC-REL]] and DataCite’s contributor types [[DATACITE-TYPES]]. To enable the use of such properties, they must be defined as RDF properties with URIs in a well-managed namespace.</p>
<p>A second approach is based on the use of W3C’s PROV ontology [[PROV-O]] which provides a powerful mechanism to express a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. In the context of work on GeoDCAT-AP, a PROV-conformant solution for expressing agent roles was agreed [[GeoDCAT-AP-RPR]]. This solution uses <code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code> in combination with a <code>dct:type</code> assertion pointing to the code list for Responsible Party Role in the INSPIRE registry. To enable the use of such types, they must be defined with URIs in a well-managed namespace. </p>
<p>Based on the experience gained with the use of domain-specific extensions for additional ‘agent roles’ in the exchange of information about Datasets and on the requests of implementors and stakeholders, the  DCAT Application Profile release 2.0.0 is  extended with additional roles as proposed by DCAT Version 2, W3C Working Draft 28 May 2019 [[VOCAB-DCAT-2-20190528]] that have proven to be useful across domains. Precisely, properties <code>dct:creator</code>, <code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code> and <code>prov:qualifiedRelation</code> have been added to <code>dcat:Dataset</code> class to further facilitate relationships between datasets and agents [[VOCAB-DCAT-QA]].</p>
<p>It should be noted that, even if a more expressive approach is used in a particular implementation, the provision of information using <code>dct:publisher</code> for the Catalogue is still mandatory under the rules laid down in the Conformance Statement in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#conformance"></a>, while the provision of information using <code>dct:publisher</code> is strongly recommended for Dataset. The provision of such information using <code>dct:publisher</code> will ensure interoperability with implementations that use the basic approach of DCAT-AP.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects</h2>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> in the context of this Application Profile is limited to information about the technical format of distributions of datasets. The properties <code>dcat:mediaType</code> and <code>dct:format</code> provide information that can be used to determine what software can be deployed to process the data. The accessibility of the data within the datasets needs to be taken care of by the software that processes the data and is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.</p>
<p><strong>Multilingual aspects</strong> related to this Application Profile concern all properties whose contents are expressed as strings (i.e. <code>rdfs:Literal</code>) with human-readable text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such text may be translated into several languages.</li>
<li>The string is an appellation of a ‘named entity’. Examples are names of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in other languages but those versions don’t need to be literal translations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string, the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, e.g. in the cases of titles, descriptions and keywords, the <strong>language tag</strong> is mandatory. </p>
<p>Language tags to be used with <code>rdfs:Literal</code> are defined by [[BCP47]], which allows the use of the "t" extension for text transformations defined in [[RFC6497]] with the field "t0" [[CLDR]] indicating a machine translation.</p>
<p>A language tag will look like: "en-t-es-t0-abcd", which conveys the information that the string is in English, translated from Spanish by machine translation using a tool named "abcd".</p>
<p>For named entities, the language tag is optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name ‘European Union’ has parallel versions in all official languages of the union, while a name like ‘W3C’ is not associated with a particular language and has no parallel versions.</p>
<p>For linking to different language versions of associated web pages (e.g. landing pages) or documentation, a content negotiation [[CONNEG]] mechanism may be used whereby different content is served based on the Accept-Languages indicated by the browser. Using such a mechanism, the link to the page or document can resolve to different language versions of the page or document.</p>
<p>All the occurrences of the property <code>dct:language</code>, which can be repeated if the metadata is provided in multiple languages, must have a URI as their object, not a literal string from the [[ISO-639]] code list.</p>
<p>How multilingual information is handled in systems, for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.</p>
